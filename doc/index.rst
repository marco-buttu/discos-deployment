.. topic:: Abstract

   This howto describes how to deploy DISCOS.  Even though the whole
   process is automatic and hides the underline technologies, before
   starting you have to spend 15 minutes to install some dependencies:
   `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/>`_,
   `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_, `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_,
   `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ and `VirtualBox
   <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_.  Look at the section :ref:`dependencies`
   to see how to install them, then go ahead and read the
   :ref:`deploy_quickstart` section.
